# Logparser, Udacity Fullstack Nanodegree Project One

This script queries the newsdata.sql Postgres database to answer the questions
asked on the [Project Description Page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd004/parts/51200cee-6bb3-4b55-b469-7d4dd9ad7765/modules/c57b57d4-29a8-4c5f-9bb8-5d53df3e48f4/lessons/bc938915-0f7e-4550-a48f-82241ab649e3/concepts/b1bc900a-44ea-43e9-a51b-d3313705277f) for the project
and outputs the answers to the console in plain text.

## Getting started.  
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes. A larger project would have
a "deployment" section in this README for production systems, but that is
overkill for our purposes.  

Simply navigate to the directory where you downloaded the script and run it by
typing `python parser.py`  

### Prerequisites
```  
Postgres >= 9.5.17  
python >= 3.5.2  
```

### Installing  
The project instructions specify that we not include the database and assume
that it is already installed, so these instructions are fairly simple. Just
clone this repository or download as a zip and extract.  
You can even open the script on GitHub and copy-paste.

### Using  
Simply navigate to the directory where you downloaded the script and run it by
typing `python parser.py`
